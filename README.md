# Git Bash & GitHub Hands-On Project  
## Fashion Retail Website

---

## Introduction

This project is a **Fashion Retail Website** developed using **HTML and CSS** as part of the **Git Bash & GitHub Hands-On Project**.  
The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience with **Git version control** and **GitHub remote repository management**.

In this project, Git Bash was used to:
- Initialize a local Git repository
- Track project files using staging and commits
- Create and manage multiple branches
- Perform merge operations
- Demonstrate and resolve a merge conflict
- Push the project to a remote GitHub repository

This project helped in understanding how version control systems manage code changes efficiently and support collaborative development.

## Commands Used

The following Git commands were used throughout the project to manage version control operations:

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git branch
git checkout
git merge
git log --oneline
git remote add origin
git push
git pull
git clone
```
